# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation

The user will need to install the inquirer and MySQL2 packages in order to use this application. Please use "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" and "npm i mysql2". 

## Usage

To use the SQL Employee Tracker Application, you will need to clone this GitHub repo to your local machine and open it in VS Code. 

You will then need to open the terminal in VS Code. To do that, simply click on "View", and then click on "Terminal". Once in the terminal, you should already be inside the application folder. If not, please follow the below instructions. 

In the terminal, go into the folder that you are currently in. To do that, type "cd " and then the location of the folder. For example, if the application folder is inside the "Documents" folder, simply type in "cd Documents" and then "cd SQL-Employee-Tracker". 

Once in the correct folder, install the required packages and source all the required databases created in the db folder.

Once completed, enter "node server.js". This will initiate the prompt that will allow you to choose what you would like to do with the employee database. 

You will be able to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, and add an employee. 

Once you have selected what you would like to action, you will be able to see a series of data or prompts to add more data as you wish.
